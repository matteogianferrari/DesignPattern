## Introduction

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. By leveraging these patterns, developers can create reusable and maintainable code, promote separation of concerns, and improve overall system architecture. This library aims to provide clear and concise examples for various design patterns, allowing you to learn and apply them in your own projects.

The design patterns covered in this library are grouped into 3 macro-directories:

- Creational Patterns
- Structural Patterns
- Behavioral Patterns

Each pattern example is presented in a separate sub-directory, along with detailed explanations and code samples. Whether you're interested in understanding how to implement the Singleton pattern or exploring the Observer pattern, you'll find valuable resources within this library.
